Modelling HII Regions With Cloudy
=================================

This repository includes all of the information you will need to reproduce
the mini-CLOUDY project that I performed as part of my PhD course at Durham
University.

The course was taught by Prof. Tom Theuns and Prof. Michele Fumagalli.

The CLOUDY parameterfile, `hii_coolstar.in`, was adapted from the one given
in the CLOUDY examples folder.
