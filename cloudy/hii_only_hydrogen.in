title dust free cool HII region model, Lexington 1995
c
c commands controlling continuum =========
black body, T = replace-me-temp K
q(h) 49
c add the CMB after hot star shape & luminosity specified
CMB 
c
c commands for density & abundances =========
hden = replace-me-dens
c cannot set abundances to 0, just go very low
abundances all 1e-10
element limit off 0
c commands controlling geometry  =========
radius = 19.477121
sphere
c this is to go deep to pick up all H recombs
stop efract -2
stop temperature 1000
c
c other commands for details     =========
c must iterate since fine structure lines are optically thick
iterate
c assume there is neutral gas beyond what we compute
double
